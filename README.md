# Useless ERC-20 token

These are standard ERC-20 tokens with several additional
properties.

Any person can mint or burn an arbitrary amount of tokens.
This property of course makes these tokens completely useless
from an economic point of view. So I called them Useless tokens.

There is also one peculiarity of transfers. If a person transfers
exactly 5 Useless tokens, then this amount is not only transferred
to the recipient, but also remains on the original account. This
feature was added from the fairy tale of the unchangeable dime.
